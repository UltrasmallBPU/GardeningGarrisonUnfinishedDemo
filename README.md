And how to play the game:
you have 60 SECOND's TO finish the lap,
you move around with arrow keys,
and you collect the yellow core thing,
and theres enemy's, which are: The purple core thing, The Techten Boss(it's an eye thing)
you MUST reach 260 score,
you usually get 10 points each time,
and lap 2 gives you 5 points instead of 10
lap 2 gives you 2 minutes to get 260 points,
And that's it.
